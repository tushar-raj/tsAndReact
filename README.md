Welcome

This is a basic program which uses typescript and reactJS

[Source](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react-&-webpack.html)

It implements a basic counter; as shown in [this tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/learning-react-getting-started-and-concepts)

Since react [plans to do away with React.createClass](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/10/react-v0.13.html) entirely in the future; the code uses React.Component.

>Our eventual goal is for ES6 classes to replace React.createClass completely, but until we have a replacement for current mixin use cases and support for class property initializers in the language, we don't plan to deprecate React.createClass.

The sandbox branch has a chessboard and a knight piece from the [React DnD tutorial](https://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/docs-tutorial.html). The code is modified to use latest react and typescript syntax.

Currently, the knight is draggable and droppable to valid squares, but using the HTML5 dnd API; and not React DnD.
